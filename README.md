# Computational-Biology-Project
This project was completed as part of the “Computational Biology” course during my Bachelor’s studies at the Lebanese American University. It explores de novo variant discovery in genetic data using Kevlar, a mapping-free variant discovery tool. De novo mutations are genetic changes present in a child but absent in both parents, contributing to the “missing heritability” of complex disorders.

The project is made up of 2 parts: 
1) Literature Review: A review of the Kevlar paper, covering:
- De novo variant discovery
- Mapping-based vs mapping-free methods
- The Kevlar workflow and its performance
(File: LitReview.pdf)

2) Practical Notebook: Documentation of:
- Installation of Kevlar and dependencies
- Running Kevlar on example dataset
- Troubleshooting errors and solutions
- Analysis of output
(File: notebook.ipynb)
